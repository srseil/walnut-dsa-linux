# walnut-dsa-linux

This repository contains an implementation of the Walnut Digital Signature Algorithm in C.
It is implemented as a Linux kernel module and integrated into the kernel's crypto API.

The implementation was done as part of a bachelor's thesis in computer science at LMU Munich.
The thesis can be found in German language in the file `docs/Bachelorarbeit_Stefan_Seil.pdf`.
For information about the digital signature algorithm, the implementation, and how to use the software at hand, see the relevant sections in the thesis.
